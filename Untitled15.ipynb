This helps in understanding the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13)Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n",
        "-->Missing data can lead to biased results and inaccurate conclusions. 1  It's crucial to handle missing data appropriately to ensure the reliability and validity of your analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14)What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?\n",
        "-->Plotly excels at creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations. It offers a wide range of chart types, extensive customization, and seamless integration with other Python libraries.\n",
